# DeepDiver
A Risky Descent for the Bold

DeepDiver is a 2D platformer built in Godot Engine, where you play as an adventurous diver plunging into ever-deeper caves. Gather loot, evade dangers, and decide: play it safe or risk it all for legendary treasures at the lowest depths.

# Gameplay Features
Risk vs. Reward: Each floor offers loot, but descending increases danger—and potential rewards.

Strategic Choice: Leave early with your earnings or push deeper for rarer prizes.

The Ultimate Prize: The bottom floor holds unmatched riches—if you survive the return trip.
